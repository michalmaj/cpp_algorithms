/*
 * We have some functions for C-style null-terminated byte strings
 *
 * // std::strlen:
 * Returns the length of the given byte string, that is, the number of characters in
 * a character array whose first element is pointed to by str up to and not including
 * the first null character. The behavior is undefined if there is no null character in
 * the character array pointed to by str.
 *
 * std::strcpy:
 * Copies the character string pointed to by src, including the null terminator, to the
 * character array whose first element is pointed to by dest.
 * The behavior is undefined if the dest array is not large enough. The behavior is
 * undefined if the strings overlap.
 *
 * std::strcmp:
 * Compares two null-terminated byte strings lexicographically.
 * It can return 3 values:
 *		 0 if the contents of both strings are equal
 *		-1 if the first character that does not match has a lower value in ptr1 than in ptr2
 *		 1 if the first character that does not match has a greater value in ptr1 than in ptr2
 *
 * std::strcat:
 * Appends a copy of the character string pointed to by src to the end of the character
 * string pointed to by dest. The character src[0] replaces the null terminator at the
 * end of dest. The resulting byte string is null-terminated.\
 * The behavior is undefined if the destination array is not large enough for the
 * contents of both src and dest and the terminating null character.
 * The behavior is undefined if the strings overlap.
